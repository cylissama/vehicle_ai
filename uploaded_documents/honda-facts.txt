--- THE PICNIC TABLE ---
1. Every single first-generation CR-V (1997–2001) came standard with a folding picnic table.
2. The table was stowed under the carpet in the rear cargo area and served as the floor cover when not in use.
3. The legs of the table are made of metal, making it surprisingly sturdy, though the top is plastic.
4. Underneath the picnic table (in the spare tire well) is a waterproof plastic bin.
5. This plastic bin has a drain plug, meaning it was designed to be used as a cooler for ice and drinks, or for storing wet muddy boots.

6. Honda offered an optional "shower kit" for the first-gen CR-V. It included a water jug, a hose, and a showerhead that plugged into the rear 12V outlet—intended for washing off muddy hiking boots (or pets).
7. The automatic transmission models featured a column shifter, which allowed for a flat floor and "walk-through" capability from the front to the back seats.
8. The front seats and rear seats can be folded down together to create a makeshift bed, often referred to as "Full Flat Mode."
9. Unlike most modern SUVs that store the spare tire under the vehicle, the first-gen CR-V mounted it on the rear swing-gate, giving it a classic off-road look and freeing up interior space.
10. The rear glass hatch can be opened independently of the rear door, but you have to use the key or a button on the driver's door to pop it; there is no handle on the glass itself.

--- ENGINEERING & SPECS ---
11. The CR-V was Honda's first SUV designed in-house. (The previous Honda Passport was actually a rebadged Isuzu Rodeo).
12. "CR-V" officially stands for "Comfortable Runabout Vehicle" according to Honda Japan, though "Compact Recreational Vehicle" is widely used in the UK and US.
13. The first generation (chassis code RD1) exclusively used a 2.0L inline-4 engine.
14. Early models (1997–1998) had the B20B engine producing only 126 horsepower.
15. Later models (1999–2001) received the B20Z engine, which bumped horsepower to 146 hp thanks to higher compression and a better intake manifold.
16. It featured 4-wheel double wishbone suspension, a complex suspension geometry usually found on sports cars, giving it handling that was much more car-like than other SUVs of the era.
17. The "Real Time 4WD" system was entirely mechanical. It used two hydraulic pumps; when the front wheels spun faster than the rear, pressure built up and engaged the rear clutch pack automatically. No electronics were involved.

--- MARKET TRIVIA ---
18. When it first launched in the US in 1997, it was only available with an automatic transmission. The 5-speed manual option wasn't added until 1998.
19. It was built on a modified Honda Civic platform (specifically the EK Civic), which helped keep costs low and reliability high.
20. In Japan, the CR-V was sold at "Honda Verno" dealerships, which were specific locations for Honda's specialty and performance products.
